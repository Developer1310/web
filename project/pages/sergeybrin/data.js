			"BIRTH",
			'Brin was born on August 21, 1973, in Moscow in the Soviet Union,to Jewish parents, Eugenia and Mikhail Brin, both graduates of Moscow State University (MSU).Brin immigrated to the United States with his family from the Soviet Union at the age of six. His father is a retired mathematics professor at the University of Maryland, and his mother a researcher at NASA\'s Goddard Space Flight Center.',

			"EDUCATION",
			'He earned his bachelor\'s degree at the University of Maryland, College Park, following in his father\'s and grandfather\'s footsteps by studying mathematics, as well as computer science. After graduation, he enrolled in Stanford University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he built a web search engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in Susan Wojcicki\'s garage in Menlo Park.',

			"SEARCH ENGINE DEVELOPMENT",
			'During an orientation for new students at Stanford, he met Larry Page. They seemed to disagree on most subjects, but after spending time together they "became intellectual soul-mates and close friends." Brin\'s focus was on developing data mining systems while Page\'s was in extending "the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other papers".Together, the pair authored a paper titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine". To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub\'s web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the PageRank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones.[16] The new algorithm relied on a new kind of technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one Web page to another, and allowed the number of links and their rank, to determine the rank of the page.',

			"PAGE AND BRIN",
			'Combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing Page\'s dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the nascent search engine with Stanford\'s broadband campus network. After filling Page\'s room with equipment, they then converted Brin\'s dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the Web. The rapid growth of their project caused Stanford\'s computing infrastructure to experience problems. Page and Brin used the former\'s basic HTML programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. They also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. As their search engine grew in popularity among Stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. In August 1996, the initial version of Google was made available on the Stanford Web site.',

			"REWARDS AND RECOGNITION",
			'In 2002, Brin, along with Larry Page, was named the MIT Technology Review TR100, as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.   In 2003, both Brin and Page received an honorary MBA from IE Business School "for embodying the entrepreneurial spirit and lending momentum to the creation of new businesses...".   In 2004, they received the Marconi Foundation Prize, the "Highest Award in Engineering", and were elected Fellows of the Marconi Foundation at Columbia University.   In 2003, Brin and Page were both Award Recipients and National Finalists for the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award.    In 2004, Brin received the American Academy of Achievement\'s Golden Plate Award with Larry Page at a ceremony in Chicago, Illinois.   In November 2009, Forbes decided Brin and Page were the fifth most powerful people in the world.   Earlier that same year, in February, Brin was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering, which is "among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer ... [and] honors those who have made outstanding contributions to engineering research, practice...".',
