      "Birth",
      'Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, to Abdulfattah Jandali and Joanne Schieble, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs.His biological father, Abdulfattah "John" (al-)Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي), grew up in Homs, Syria, and was born into an Arab Muslim household. While an undergraduate at the American University of Beirut, Lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in prison for his political activities. He pursued a PhD at the University of Wisconsin, where he met Joanne Carole Schieble, a Catholic of Swiss and German descent. As a doctoral candidate, Jandali was a teaching assistant for a course Schieble was taking, although both were the same age. Mona Simpson, Jobs\'s biological sister, notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating a Muslim. Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\'s official biographer, additionally states that Schieble\'s father "threatened to cut Joanne off completely" if she continued the relationship.',
